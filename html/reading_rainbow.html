          Written by Marge Pierce and published in 1991, He, She and It depicts parallel societies: one historical, the other a dystopic near-future.  In each, there is a small Jewish enclave struggling to survive whose intellectual leaders create Golems (one of mud, the other of metal and silicon) to defend them. Also in each, they soon discover that one cannot create a sentient tool.

          I don't want to give away the ending, so I'll leave you with this quote:

              "Creation is always perilous, for it gives true life to what has been inchoate and voice to what has been dumb. It makes known what has been unknown, that perhaps we were more comfortable not knowing. The new is necessarily dangerous. You, too, must come to accept that of your nature, Yod, for you are truly new under the sun."
